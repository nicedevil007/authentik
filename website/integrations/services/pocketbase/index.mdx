## What is PocketBase

> This guide explains how to configure PocketBase to use authentik as the OAuth provider for logging in to the Web GUI.

:::note
If you are using an application that relies on PocketBase as its backend, you can replace the placeholders used here with the application's name.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `pocketbase.company` is the FQDN of the PocketBase installation.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.
:::

## authentik configuration

Start the wizard for adding a new application.

**1. Application:**

- Name: `PocketBase`
- Slug: `pocketbase`

**2. Choose a Provider**

Select `OAuth2/OpenID Provider`

**3. Configure Provider**

Select implicit or explicit authorization flow as desired.

Take note of the Client ID and Client Secret, you'll need to give them to PocketBase later.

- Redirect URIs/Origins (RegEx): `https://_pocketbase.company_/api/oauth2-redirect`
- Signing Key: Select any available signing keys.

Leave the rest as default values.

## PocketBase configuration

1. Sign in to Beszel with a browser of your choice and access the system setting by using this URL https://_pocketbase.company_/_/#/settings.

2. Disable **Hide collection create and edit controls** and click **Save changes**.

3. Open the **users** submenu by clicking the **Collections** icon in the left menu or by accessing this URL: https://_pocketbase.company_/_/#/collections?collection=pb_users_auth.

4. Click the gear icon next to **users**, then select the **Options** tab.

5. Enable **OAuth2** by toggling the corresponding switch.

6. Click **+ Add provider** and select **OpenID Connect**.

7. Enter the following details from the authentik provider:
    - Set **Client ID** to _client-id_
    - Set **Client secret** to _client-secret_
    - Set **Display name** to **authentik**
    - Set **Auth URL** to https://_authentik.company_/application/o/authorize/
    - Set **Token URL** to https://_authentik.company_/application/o/token/
    - Set **User info URL** to https://_authentik.company_/application/o/userinfo/

## Test the login

- Open your web browser and go to: https://_pocketbase.company_/#/login.
- Click **authentik** to log in.
- You should be redirected to authentik (following the login flow you configured). After logging in, authentik will redirect you back to https://_pocketbase.company_.
- If you successfully return to the PocketBase WebGUI, the login is working correctly.
